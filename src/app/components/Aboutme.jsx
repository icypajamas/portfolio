            Iâ€™m a first-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in
            web development and problem-solving. I enjoy building clean,
            functional, and modern websites using React and Next.js. My goal is
            to grow into a full-stack developer while exploring areas like
            cybersecurity and automation along the way. I tried coding 5 years ago in C#
            for the first time. That's when I knew what I wanted to do. Now I'm here, learning
            languages and exploring technologies. I'm excited to see where I end up. Take me away!
